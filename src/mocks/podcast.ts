        "Sam Cooke was a lot of things: soul superstar, civil rights champion, whip smart entrepreneur. But he was also a serial womanizer with an unbridled libido. On December 11, 1964, Cooke was shot to death by Bertha Lee Franklin, manager of the Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles. The killing was ruled a justifiable homicide due to Cooke’s unruly, drunken behavior, which involved him holding another woman captive in his hotel room and allegedly raping her earlier in the evening. With full appreciation of the #MeToo moment we are currently all living through as a culture, Disgraceland, with fresh eyes, looks into this crime and the successful effort by Sam Cooke’s family and powerful music industry colleagues to salvage his legacy and reputation by personally discrediting his victim.\n\nTo see the full list of contributors, see the show notes at www.disgracelandpod.com.\n\nThis episode was originally published on March 6, 2018.\n\nSign up for our newsletter and get the inside dirt on events, merch and other awesomeness - GET THE NEWSLETTER\n\nFollow Jake and DISGRACELAND:\nInstagram\nYouTube\nX (formerly Twitter) \nFacebook Fan Group\nTikTok\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.

        "Seven arrests in twelve years and more than a couple sleepless nights inside a London prison. This reads like the description of a stereotypical Sunset Strip metalhead, not that of pop prince George Michael. George’s criminal transgressions include a bust for a “lewd act” in a public place, a crack addiction, numerous car crashes. George Michael was on a collision course with an early death, but he died of a broken heart. Along the way he made great music. Here’s his story.\nWhich early MTV icon is your favorite? Why?

        "Years before a free album made them the most unpopular popular band on the planet, U2 ran into the arms of America. In 1987, touring behind their blockbuster album The Joshua Tree, their songs became lightning rods for violence. They received death threats in the States and became targets of terrorists back in their native Ireland. But it was the song “Exit,” written from the POV of a killer, that was linked with pure evil. That song allegedly inspired a man to hop an overnight bus to Los Angeles, carrying a loaded .357 Magnum and a copy of The Joshua Tree, ready to do whatever it took to meet the women he was obsessed with.\nThis episode contains themes that may be disturbing to some listeners, including descriptions of stalking.\nThis episode was originally published on November 14, 2023.\nTo see the full list of contributors, see the show notes at www.disgracelandpod.com.\nSign up for our newsletter and get the inside dirt on events, merch and other awesomeness - GET THE NEWSLETTER\n\nFollow Jake and DISGRACELAND:\nInstagram\nYouTube\nX (formerly Twitter) \nFacebook Fan Group\nTikTok\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.

        "Dennis Hopper revolutionized American cinema by bringing the counterculture to the mainstream with his 1969 film Easy Rider. But he also lived his life in tandem with his art, on the fringes of society and sanity. His stubborn attitude and crazy ideas quickly transformed him from a hippie prophet into a longhaired loser. Hopper's journey from success to failure and back again took him through jungles, deserts, and mountains, and involved varying degrees of drugs, guns, hallucinations, and ex-wives - all part of a lifelong search to save his career, and his life.\nThis episode contains content that may me disturbing to some listeners, including domestic violence.\nDennis Hopper brought a rock 'n' roll sensibility to filmmaking.

        "Richard Pryor was one of the funniest people who ever lived. He elevated stand-up comedy to an art form. But the real life that informed his stand-up – a life of pool halls, brothels, stabbings, shootings, and lots and lots of cocaine – was a source of constant pain. A pain that he managed with a freebase habit so out of control it nearly killed him before he was even 40 years old.\nThis episode contains themes that may be disturbing to some listeners, including descriptions of domestic violence and suicide. If you're thinking about suicide, or are worried about a friend or loved one, call the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.\nWhich comedian from your childhood cracked you up the most?
